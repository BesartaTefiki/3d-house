# 3D House Project

3D House is an immersive visualization experience that showcases a virtual environment crafted with careful attention to detail. It is designed for users who appreciate architectural modeling and virtual tours.
### Project Overview (University Project)
Upon launching the 3D House project, users will be greeted with a picturesque scene that includes a quaint house complemented by a well-maintained garden. The garden hosts a variety of elements meticulously modeled in Blender, such as a red car, lush green trees, and a charming wooden fence that frames the property. A cozy table setup invites users to envision serene outdoor moments.
The house itself boasts two windows, through which the warm glow of interior lighting beckons. Users can navigate inside the house using the mouse, entering a space of comfort dominated by a plush sofa that invites relaxation. The interactive interface allows for on-the-fly adjustments to lighting and other settings, ensuring each visitor can tailor the ambiance to their liking.
For a hands-on experience with this virtual abode and its surroundings, follow the installation and running instructions to begin your exploration of the 3D House.
